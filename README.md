Bug - Report ( Word Format )


JPetStore: https://jpetstore.aspectran.com/ 

JPetStore is an online store application designed to demonstrate the functionality of an e-commerce website. The application allows users to browse a selection of pets and pet-related products, add them to their shopping cart, and proceed with checkout. The system includes features for both customers and administrators. 

I have aimed at ensuring the quality and functionality of the JPetStore e-commerce application. The testing process includes functional testing, usability testing, performance testing, and identifying and reporting bugs in the system.
